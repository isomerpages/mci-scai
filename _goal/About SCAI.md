## Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI)

The rapid advancement of AI has the potential to revolutionise industries and enhance our quality of life, transforming the way we live and work. However, there are many potential pitfalls in future AI development and deployment that may constrain our ability to harness the technology, e.g., accuracy, bias, and resource-efficiency. The ubiquity of AI technologies will also require drawing on multiple domains of expertise, to ensure AI can be unleashed for the benefit of societies.

To overcome these challenges, the [Ministry of Communications and Information](https://mci.gov.sg/) and [Smart Nation Group](https://smartnation.gov.sg/), in partnership with [Topos Institute](https://topos.institute/) are organising the inaugural Singapore Conference on AI from 4 to 6 December 2023. The conference aims to bring together over 40 distinguished experts from various fields of academia, industry, and government.

Together, delegates will explore and articulate critical questions of AI that, if answered, will enable AI to truly be developed and deployed for the global good. This will include determining the importance and actionability of these areas â€“ as well as how to measure progress in addressing them.
