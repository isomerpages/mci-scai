## Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI)

AI has the potential to enhance our quality of life, revolutionise industries, and transform the way we live and work. However, there are many potential challenges that may constrain our ability to harness the technology to benefit societies and people, such as accuracy, bias, and resource-efficiency.

To overcome these challenges, the [Ministry of Communications and Information](https://mci.gov.sg/) and [Smart Nation Group](https://smartnation.gov.sg/), in partnership with [Topos Institute](https://topos.institute/),  organised the inaugural Singapore Conference on AI from 4 to 6 December 2023. The conference brings together 42 distinguished experts from various fields of academia, industry, and government.

Drawing on their diverse domains of expertise, delegates explored and articulated critical questions of AI that, if answered, will enable the development and deployment of AI for societies to flourish.
