## Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI)

AI has the potential to enhance our quality of life, revolutionise industries, and transform the way we live and work. However, there are many potential challenges that may constrain our ability to harness the technology to benefit societies and people, e.g., accuracy, bias, and resource-efficiency. 

To overcome these challenges, the [Ministry of Communications and Information](https://mci.gov.sg/) and [Smart Nation Group](https://smartnation.gov.sg/), in partnership with [Topos Institute](https://topos.institute/) are organising the inaugural Singapore Conference on AI from 4 to 6 December 2023. The conference aims to bring together over 40 distinguished experts from various fields of academia, industry, and government.

Drawing on their diverse domains of expertise, delegates will explore and articulate critical questions of AI that, if answered, will enable AI to be developed and deployed for the global good. This will include determining the importance and actionability of these areas â€“ as well as how to measure progress in addressing them.
