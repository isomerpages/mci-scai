## Identifying the right questions to realise AI's full potential

SCAI brings together a community of AI experts for an in-depth dialogue.

Over three days, our delegates will explore and articulate top questions impeding AI development and deployment today – impeding AI’s true potential to do global good. We believe asking the right questions is the first critical step in bringing us closer to the answers we need.

Starting from broad areas of concern, we will systematically elicit, cluster and refine questions. For each question, we will highlight the context, impetus, promising approaches, and measurements of progress.
