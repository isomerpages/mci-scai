## Identifying the right questions to realise AI's full potential

SCAI brings together a community of experts for an in-depth dialogue on the key questions surrounding AI.

Through three days, our experts will explore and articulate top questions marring AI innovation and adoption today – impeding AI’s true potential to do global good. We believe asking the right questions is the first critical step in bringing us closer to the answers we need.

Starting from broad areas of concern, we will systematically employ a winnowing methodology to pinpoint well-defined questions that demand attention and resolution.
