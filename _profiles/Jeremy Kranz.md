Jeremy Kranz moved to Silicon Valley in 1997 and has been a VC for more than 25 years. He started his career at Intel Capital in 1997 and experienced the entire dotcom bubble and crash. In 2004, Jeremy joined GIC to build a tech investment program focused on early investing. Jeremy created and led GIC’s global tech investment program across two decades. The fund established itself as a meaningful shareholder and partner to iconic companies such as Affirm, Alibaba, Coinbase, Anchorage, Doordash, Flipkart, Snowflake, Snap, Nubank, Snowflake, Zoom, Razorpay, Checkout.com, Automattic and others. 

In 2015, Jeremy partnered with the Singapore government to create The Bridge Forum – a platform that added value to venture-stage companies seeking to go global by connecting them with key strategic international partners. The Bridge Forum today is a well-respected community of C-level executives that expands business opportunities for Singapore’s key partners around the world. 

In January 2022, Jeremy left GIC to form Sentinel Global, a venture fund anchored by several well-respected institutional investors. Sentinel’s investment thesis is that the next iteration of the internet will be based on open computing architectures that allow for greater interoperability, lower cost and increased security. The team at Sentinel Global provides a bridge between founders and adopters of pioneering technologies that enable open computing. Learn more at www.sentinelglobal.xyz.
