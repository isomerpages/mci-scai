## Foreword to the SCAI Questions

These Questions were conceptualised and written by the SCAI delegates over the 3 days of the conference, using a process designed to synthesise diverse views from experts. Each of the 12 SCAI Questions is envisioned to be a comprehensive articulation of a foundational, yet tractable area of AI development and/or deployment. The 12 SCAI Questions taken as a whole, are meant to be a holistic formulation of the challenges that should be addressed by the global AI community to allow humanity to flourish.

Good questions are hard to frame, especially in a domain as emergent and boundary-spanning as AI. The SCAI Questions are the best-effort of the delegates gathering together, debating and then consolidating their views over 3 days in Singapore. They are certainly not final, and we invite commentators and researchers to use these Questions as a springboard for further research, collaboration and innovation.

In terms of format, each Question begins by stating upfront the context and assumptions which the delegates had in mind, followed by an elaboration of the possible approaches to answering the question, known challenges, and ways we might recognise progress.

The SCAI Questions are a collective and collaborative product of the conversations amongst SCAI delegates. They do not necessarily represent the views of individual participants, or the organising parties of SCAI.

The ordering of the SCAI Questions is solely for ease of reference and does not reflect a hierarchy of importance.
